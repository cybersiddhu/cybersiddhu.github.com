I am Siddhartha Basu,  bioinformatics software developer for 7+ years,  currently
working at [dictyBase](http://dictybase.org).

### Short Bio
Did my Ph.D in microbiology and in the last year of my graduation got interested in
linux and biological sequence analysis. Then started programming by myself, and eventually landed
my first postdoc in analyzing mitochondrial proteome.
[MiGenes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16368773) was the success of my first
programming venture with bioinformatics database. For the last 4+ years at dictyBase, doing full monty
on a biological database,  writing web applications, database integration,  data display,
software engineering,  architechture and last but not the least linux system
administration.
